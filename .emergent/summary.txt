<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built an AI-powered travel platform, Yomigo, from scratch, leveraging FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. Initial development focused on core AI features: vibe-based matching, NLP review analysis, and smart itinerary generation using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Anthropic Claude via the . The process was iterative, marked by continuous user feedback loops. Key challenges included debugging frontend-backend communication, refining AI prompts, and implementing a multi-step user experience. A significant refactor transformed the application from a tab-based interface to a multi-page structure with React Router, improving UX. Subsequent work addressed user requests for authentication, saved itineraries, AI-driven duration recommendations, and improved currency display, demonstrating an adaptive and problem-solving approach to development.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an AI-powered travel platform, Yomigo, offering personalized, vibe-based travel experiences.
**Core Features:**
1.  **Vibe-Based Destination Matching**: Curates destinations based on user preferences. (OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-5)
2.  **NLP Review Analyzer**: Extracts safety, cleanliness, and sentiment insights from travel reviews, ideally fetching them automatically from the internet. (Hugging Face models)
3.  **Smart Itinerary Builder**: Generates personalized travel plans including stays, transport, and activity recommendations with real-time adjustments for dates and costs. (Anthropic Claude)

**Key Enhancements Implemented:**
*   Initial UI with a hero section.
*   Multi-step itinerary creation: preferences, AI-suggested destinations, activity selection, final itinerary.
*   Integration of travel dates for seasonal activity recommendations.
*   AI-driven activity suggestions with cost and duration.
*   Display of local currency with conversion options.
*   User authentication (register/login) and saved itineraries.
*   AI-recommended ideal trip duration.
*   Multi-page application structure with proper navigation.
*   Download and sharing functionality for itineraries.
*   Destination Safety Check.

**Pending/Ongoing Product Requirements:**
*   Refine currency suggestions to allow user-selected display currency with local default.
*   Address default traveler count.
*   Reimplement activity selection based on time of travel.
*   Further enhance the Review Analysis to be more user-friendly and fully automated.
*   Complete bookmark/save itinerary functionality for logged-in users.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   ****: This is the core FastAPI application.
    -   **Purpose**: Defines all backend API endpoints for vibe matching, review analysis, smart itinerary generation, currency conversion, user authentication (register, login, refresh token), saving/retrieving itineraries, fetching destination reviews, and suggesting trip duration.
    -   **Changes**: Initially set up with basic AI endpoints, then iteratively enhanced with complex itinerary logic, currency conversion, authentication, and review fetching. Pydantic models are used for request/response validation. Integrates  for LLM calls and currency conversion. Handles JWT for user sessions.
-   ****: Stores environment variables like  and .
-   ****: The main React component.
    -   **Purpose**: Manages global state, routing, and overall application layout. Integrates  and sets up  for navigation between different pages.
    -   **Changes**: Evolved from a tab-based interface to a multi-page application using  and . Added  for authentication context.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Provides global navigation links (Home, Vibe Match, Plan Trip, Safety Hub, My Trips, Login/Logout).
    -   **Changes**: Updated to reflect new page structure, rebrand to Yomigo, and integrate authentication-dependent links.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Manages user authentication state (login status, user info, JWT tokens) across the application. Provides login, logout, register, and token refresh functionalities.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to support user authentication.
-   ****: The landing page of the application.
    -   **Purpose**: Presents the application's value proposition with a hero section, key features, and a Start Exploring call to action.
    -   **Changes**: Refined UI, integrated images from .
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Allows users to input their travel vibe and get AI-powered destination suggestions. Provides an option to generate an itinerary for a selected destination.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated calendar for dates when passing to itinerary builder.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Part of the multi-step itinerary builder, allowing users to select a destination, dates, and activities.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced to include AI duration recommendations and activity selection.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Allows users to directly plan an itinerary for a chosen destination without going through vibe matching first.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created. Integrated AI duration recommendations.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Displays the detailed, AI-generated travel itinerary.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced with download, sharing, currency conversion features, and integrated bookmarking functionality.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Provides tools for destination safety checks and review analysis.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced to make the review analyzer more prominent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding several features of the Yomigo platform. The most recent focus was on the ItineraryPage () to implement:

1.  **Bookmark/Save Functionality**: The AI engineer started adding the ability for users to save their created itineraries. This involves integrating with the backend  endpoint and updating the UI to include a bookmark or save button.
2.  **Currency Suggestion/Selection**: The user requested the ability to choose the currency for cost display, with the local currency of the destination as default. The AI was in the process of enhancing the  to support this, likely involving updates to how currency conversion is displayed and potentially a UI element for currency selection.

The backend now supports saving and fetching itineraries for authenticated users, and there's an endpoint for currency conversion. The frontend  and  are in place to handle user authentication.  has been created to display saved itineraries. The  has been extensively modified in the last few steps (Chat 277-282) to integrate these new features, specifically around saving/bookmarking.
